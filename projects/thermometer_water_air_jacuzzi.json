  "title": "DS18B20-Based Water and Air Thermometer for Outdoor Jacuzzi",

  "date": "August 2021",
  "technologies": ["Arduino", "OneWire", "DS18B20"],

  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project was to create a simple thermometer to measure both water and air temperature for an outdoor wood-fired Jacuzzi.",
    "I built it at home, based on an idea I discussed with my dad, who is an electronics technician and taught me electronics from a young age."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Purchased two DS18B20 temperature sensors and 7-segment LED displays.",
    "Selected a suitable microcontroller (ATtiny85) and an LED matrix driver communicating via I2C.",
    "Designed a user interface using four LED digits - showing e.g. 'b38.3' for water temperature and 'p18.7' for air temperature.",
    "Soldered the entire board and wrote the firmware for the ATtiny85.",
    "Added a light sensor (photoresistor) to automatically dim the display in low ambient light.",
    "Prepared the enclosure, cabling, and power supply. One sensor is integrated into a water pipe, the second is placed nearby to measure air temperature.",
    "Installed the finished device on the Jacuzzi together with my dad."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The system has been working reliably for years without the need for any maintenance - my dad is happy with the outcome.",
    "The project is quite old now and could use a refresh. One future idea is to design a floating wireless sensor node (powered by a CR2032) that would transmit temperature readings to a separate LED display.",
    "I'm also considering an ESP-based upgrade to log temperatures and display a web-based graph interface - but that's only idea for the future."
