  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project is to use the MATLAB Simulink toolset to perform system identification of a composite heater and then design and deploy a controller to an embedded system.",
    "This initiative is conducted independently within the AGH Solar Boat Student Research Group. The motivation behind this project is to gain hands-on experience with model-based design and deployment before conducting more advanced experiments."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Refactored the old embedded software I originally wrote for the composite heater, splitting it into modular files and adding UART-based data logging.",
    "Developed a MATLAB script to receive CSV-formatted data, visualize it with plots, and support system identification.",
    "Conducted a step response experiment, filtered the data, and fitted a transfer function model to represent the plant.",
    "Built a Simulink model replicating the system, integrating parts of the original C code using LCT (Legacy Code Tool), effectively creating a digital twin.",
    "Designed a PID controller in Simulink, manually tuning each component (P, I, D) to understand their individual influence on performance.",
    "Generated C code from the Simulink model for deployment to the embedded target (done), actual deployment and testing are still in progress.",
    "Planned final stages include real-world tests and comparison between the plant model and actual hardware response."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The project is ongoing. Initial results show a successful system identification and a working simulation model with integrated legacy code.",
    "Pending work includes deploying the controller to the embedded system and validating it through physical experiments.",
    "In the future, the same methodology can be used for more complex systems or applied in closed-loop control of onboard boat electronics."
