  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project was to measure the angular velocity of the boat's propeller, powered by a BLDC motor, in real-time. The design emphasized minimal weight and cost. Previously, the motor was controlled by sending a setpoint to the ESC, with no feedback on the actual RPM. This made it difficult to analyze the boat's dynamic response — especially since the ESC's behavior is undocumented and sensitive to battery voltage and load.",
    "During a weekend of field tests at Lake Rożnowskie, I researched, designed, and implemented both the hardware and firmware to measure the motor's RPM using an IR reflective proximity sensor as a tachometer. This system will support future work in propulsion modeling and closed-loop motor control."

  "highlights": [
    "Designed a compact, non-intrusive RPM sensing system using an IR reflective sensor aimed at the rotating engine housing with a reflective sticker on it.",
    "Selected an available free microcontroller pin on the control board and configured a high-resolution 32-bit timer for precise measurement.",
    "Added a simple RC low-pass filter to the sensor signal line; cutoff frequency was calculated based on the expected RPM range.",
    "Processed tachometer pulses on the STM32F446RE using GPIO interrupts and counted revolutions with the timer peripheral.",
    "Implemented embedded C firmware (bare-metal, CubeMX + HAL) to compute rotational speed from pulse periods.",
    "Developed a simple algorithm to detect and filter out invalid readings, such as rotations that are too slow or too fast to be realistic.",
    "Utilized a FreeRTOS task to periodically acquire data and transmit it over the CAN bus.",
    "Tested the system in outdoor lake conditions during full-speed propulsion trials."

  "results": [
    "The system successfully measured the motor RPM in real-time during field tests, providing reliable and actionable data. The IR sensor was a robust and low-cost non-intrusive sensing solution. The collected data enabled visualization of the nonlinear relationship between RPM, ESC setpoint, and applied voltage — supporting future system identification and closed-loop control design.",
    "Challenges included signal noise and unquantified accuracy. Future work should focus on validation against calibrated tachometers, improving filtering techniques, and performing sensor calibration."
