    "title": "Autonomous Boat Ball Launcher - Improved Racquet Ball Delivery System for RoboBoat 2025",

  "date": "February 2025",
  "technologies": ["FDM 3D Printing", "BLDC", "PWM", "Servo", "STM32F446", "Embedded C"],

  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project was to build a second, improved iteration of a racquet ball launcher for the autonomous vessel Barka. The launcher was required for the 'Object Delivery' task in the RoboBoat 2025 competition.",
    "The project was developed as part of the AGH Solar Boat student research group. The first prototype, created by another team member, had fundamental design flaws and was not reliable."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Redesigned the entire system based on the original idea while resolving critical mechanical and control issues.",
    "Replaced the non-waterproof stepper motor (which lacked position feedback) with a standard waterproof RC servo, simplifying control and increasing reliability.",
    "Redefined most of the part dimensions and re-designed all components to be printable with FDM 3D printing.",
    "Simplified the mechanical design and standardized fasteners - reduced the variety of screw sizes to ease maintenance and assembly during competitions.",
    "Designed and printed a low-friction plunger using IGUS filament to reduce friction and increase reliability.",
    "Like in the original concept, reused two BLDC motors from an old drone to drive the dual flywheels responsible for launching the ball.",
    "Developed custom firmware to generate PWM signals via timer peripherial of the custom STM32 based 'Barka-Board' to control the BLDC motors and the servo.",
    "Developed and implemented control algorithms for safe and reliable firing, including integration with a custom RC transmitter interface and with the CAN interface (which I also designed and programmed) to allow remote and autonomous operation as well."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The second iteration of the launcher was significantly more robust, serviceable, and competition-ready.",
    "Key improvements included waterproofing, simpler maintenance, and increase in reliability.",
    "The team was satisfied with the final result, and the launcher was integrated onto the Autonomous Barka vessel for RoboBoat 2025."
