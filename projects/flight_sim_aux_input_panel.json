  "technologies": ["SparkFun Pro Micro", "Arduino", "Analog potentiometers", "Button matrix", "USB HID", "Basic electronics"],
  
  "overview": [
    "This was one of my first embedded projects, aimed at improving flight simulator immersion by adding a custom auxiliary input device.",
    "The goal was to control more simulator parameters (e.g., flaps, propeller pitch, mixture) than a typical joystick or keyboard allowed.",
    "I designed a compact control panel based on a SparkFun Pro Micro board, using five analog slide potentiometers and a button matrix to provide extended input capabilities."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Selected and wired five analog slide potentiometers for continuous control of simulator parameters.",
    "Implemented a button matrix to allow additional discrete inputs without using many GPIO pins.",
    "Wrote Arduino firmware that presented the panel as a USB HID joystick for plug-and-play compatibility with flight sims.",
    "Hand-soldered all components on a perfboard and tested integration with flight simulator game."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The panel successfully extended flight sim control capabilities with five additional analog axes and multiple buttons.",
    "It provided a much more immersive experience, especially for controlling aircraft systems during simulation.",
    "Potential future improvements include adding a proper enclosure, motorized potentiometers, and additional switches to increase the number of input channels."
