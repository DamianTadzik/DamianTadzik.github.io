  "overview": [
    "A small PCB designed as a CAN interface for Jetson Orin.The board allows soldering either a through-hole or surface-mount CAN transceiver, with only one used at a time based on availability.",
    "The board features ESD protection (TVS diode), filtering capacitors, and standardized connectors used within the AGH Solar Boat team: 4-pin CAN connectors, a 5-pin Jetson interface connector, and a dedicated port for connecting an Xsens IMU via the factory cable.",
    "The design is an improvement over a previous version, adding more connectors and better compatibility."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Designed a schematic and PCB layout in EasyEDA with both SMD and THT footprints for CAN transceivers (compatibility with available lab stock).",
    "Added filtering capacitors, a TVS diode protecting CANH/CANL lines, and a clean connector layout for seamless system integration.",
    "Included a dedicated port for the Xsens IMU, compatible with its factory cable â€” eliminating the need for custom adapters.",
    "Ensured connector compatibility with AGH Solar Boat CAN standard (4-pin connectors).",
    "Prepared and ordered PCBs, with a concise note about the board's purpose printed on the solder mask.",
    "Manually soldered and tested multiple units (SMD + THT) to ensure field-ready redundancy in case of failure or misplacement."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The board improved system reliability and simplified interfacing with the IMU and Jetson Orin.",
    "The modular form factor and dual transceiver compatibility provided flexibility for future projects.",
    "Future revisions may further miniaturize the board or include additional diagnostic LEDs."
