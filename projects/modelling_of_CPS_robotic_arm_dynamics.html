      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to derive and simulate a nonlinear dynamic model of a simple two-degree-of-freedom robotic arm.
        The work was done as part of the “Modelling of Cyber-Physical Systems” course at AGH.
        The system was modeled analytically using Lagrangian mechanics, implemented in MATLAB and Simulink, and then controlled using LQR-based strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main objective was to understand and apply concepts of control-oriented modeling and nonlinear-to-linear approximation techniques,
        as well as to explore gain scheduling based on workspace partitioning.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Derived nonlinear dynamic equations of motion using Lagrange formalism and the MATLAB Symbolic Toolbox.</li>
        <li>Partitioned the robot workspace into regions with predefined center points (equilibrium points) and boundaries.</li>
        <li>Performed local linearization around each region center and computed individual LQR gain matrices.</li>
        <li>Implemented nonlinear differential equations in Simulink to simulate the real (nonlinear) system.</li>
        <li>Developed a control system based first on a single LQR controller, and later extended to a gain scheduling approach.</li>
        <li>Designed a switching mechanism that replaces the active LQR gain matrix (K) and the reference linearization points (x0, u0) depending on the robot's current workspace region.</li>
        <li>Used variant subsystems to enable easy switching between different plant, controller, and actuator implementations.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Interesting Challenge</h2>
      <p>
        One of the key challenges was implementing gain scheduling logic directly in Simulink. This was achieved by creating a MATLAB Function block
        that dynamically reads controller data structures from the workspace and updates the active gain matrix during runtime.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The developed Simulink model successfully demonstrated nonlinear robot behavior with region-specific LQR controllers and smooth gain switching.
        The structure is modular, clean, and ready to be reused for more complex robotic systems or physical modeling extensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Planned future work includes building a Simscape-based physical model of the arm for validation and comparing both models' responses under identical control inputs.
