  "date": "October 2019",
  "technologies": ["Arduino Nano", "Discrete RGB LED chains", "NPN transistors", "PWM control", "Low-voltage electronics"],

  "overview": [
    "This was a simple family electronics project to add colorful lighting to small Christmas trees at home. The idea came from my dad, who bought a set of red, green, and blue decorative light chains based on small pearl-shaped LEDs.",
    "We brainstormed how to combine these into proper RGB chains using transparent heat-shrink tubing, forming individual RGB light points.",
    "I handled the electronics and programming: creating a driver circuit based on transistors and writing the firmware for an Arduino Nano that would randomly blink each color channel in creative patterns."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Hand-assembled RGB light chains by combining separate red, green, and blue LED strands.",
    "Used transparent heat-shrink tubing to group the LEDs and create RGB 'pixels'.",
    "Designed a basic transistor-based driver circuit to switch each color channel.",
    "Wrote firmware for an Arduino Nano to control lighting sequences using random effects and timing.",
    "Enclosed the control electronics and power supply in a sealed casing for protection.",
    "Delivered a fully working set of lights that brightened up our Christmas decorations."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The RGB lighting system works reliably and looks great on the mini Christmas trees during the winter season.",
    "While simple, the project combined hands-on soldering, analog electronics, and embedded programming.",
    "A fun early project that strengthened my interest in microcontroller-based hardware design."
