  "technologies": ["CSS", "JS", "HTML", "Github Pages", "JSON"],

  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project was to build a personal portfolio website that lists and showcases all of my technical and engineering projects in a structured and lightweight format.",
    "The page was designed and implemented from scratch using plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is hosted using GitHub Pages. Each project is described using a standalone JSON file, and the webpage dynamically loads and renders project data directly from these files.",
    "The site is intended to serve as both a personal archive and a public showcase, making it easy to share my work with others (e.g. during recruitment)."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Designed a responsive HTML layout for both the project list and individual project pages.",
    "Implemented JavaScript logic to load metadata from `projects/projects_list.json`, dynamically render project cards, and fetch full project data from separate JSON files.",
    "Structured each project entry as a self-contained JSON file with fields for title, date, technologies, highlights, overview, results, and images.",
    "Developed a modular page template (`project.html`) that loads and renders any selected project based on a `file=` query parameter in the URL.",
    "Created reusable image + caption rendering logic and markdown-like text formatting for highlights and paragraphs.",
    "Used GitHub Pages to host the static site publicly and set up automatic deployment from the repository.",
    "Kept the design minimal and lightweight, avoiding large frameworks and dependencies, making it fast and easy to maintain."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The portfolio page is fully functional, fast, and easy to expand with new projects just by adding JSON files and image assets.",
    "It makes it easier to present my engineering and hobby projects without relying on external platforms.",
    "Potential future work includes adding filtering by tags, a search bar, or moving to my own hosting if needed.",
    "The content is still under development â€” I'm continuously adding project descriptions and images as time allows."
