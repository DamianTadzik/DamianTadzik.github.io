  "title": "Master's Thesis - Small-Scale Hydrofoil Boat: Hardware Design",

  "date": "June 2024 - September 2025",
  "technologies": [
    "CAD",
    "Composite manufacturing",
    "CNC machining",
    "Carbon fiber lamination",
    "3D printing"
  ],

  "overview": [
    "This project focuses on the hardware design and construction of a small-scale radio-controlled hydrofoil boat.",
    "The platform is intended for experimental validation of sensing and control algorithms before deployment on a full-scale solar-powered racing boat.",
    "This work constitutes the hardware-design part of my master's thesis."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Scaled down the full-sized 'Celka' boat model and CNC-milled the mold for the hull.",
    "Collaboratively sanded and prepared the mold surface with team members.",
    "Laminated the carbon fiber hull inside the mold with a colleague.",
    "Adapted the propulsion system and controller from a different boat (R.O.B.U.R.).",
    "Electronics, foil mounting, and control systems are in progress."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The project is still in progress. Key milestones like electronics integration and on-water tests are planned for the coming weeks."
