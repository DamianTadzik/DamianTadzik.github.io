  "overview": [
    "The idea for this project emerged right after building the first iteration of the hydrofoil system for the solar racing boat. Its purpose was to provide real-time feedback to the pilot about the current flight height above water.",
    "I was the pilot at that time, and I came up with the concept because it was difficult to judge the height while sitting inside the boat during flight.",
    "The system measures the distance between the boat's bow and the water surface and signals the pilot whether to increase, decrease, or maintain the current height."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Proposed the idea, selected the microcontroller, and designed the hardware using components available in the workshop.",
    "Used a Chinese RKS32 STM32 clone (Bluepill), three JSN-SR04T waterproof ultrasonic sensors, and red/green LEDs switched via transistors.",
    "Designed and built the mechanical housing and sensor mounting system on the boatâ€™s bow.",
    "Worked with a teammate who implemented the firmware for reading sensor data and controlling the LED display; we jointly tuned the threshold ranges.",
    "A notable challenge was configuring GPIO and peripherals on the RKS32 chip, which lacked several features found in genuine STM32 devices."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The indicator helped the pilot fly the boat more smoothly and maintain stable altitude during hydrofoil operation.",
    "For future versions, it would be beneficial to use a better microcontroller and more accurate sensors distributed across multiple points on the hull.",
    "The system could also be integrated with an automatic flight controller to enable closed-loop altitude stabilization."
