  "overview": [
    "This project aimed to develop a reliable and reusable CAN bus data logger for the main telemetry network of the AGH Solar Boat team's hydrofoil racing boat \"Celka\".",
    "The idea originated from the absence of a functional telemetry system that could both record and store data for later analysis â€” essential for testing, diagnostics, and performance optimization.",
    "A secondary goal was to measure hydrodynamic drag by integrating a load cell (strain gauge) and an external ADC (HX711) into the system.",
    "The project also formed the basis of my engineering thesis, where I documented and defended the design and implementation."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Designed a prototype using an STM32F446RE microcontroller with microSD card storage via SDIO interface.",
    "Configured STM32 peripherals including CAN, SDIO, and GPIO with interrupt handling for real-time performance.",
    "Implemented a FreeRTOS-based system with three main tasks: CAN message reception, SD card data logging, and load cell data acquisition.",
    "Wrote a custom FreeRTOS task using GPIO interrupts and the HX711 ADC protocol to reliably sample load cell measurements.",
    "Created a modular and extensible firmware structure to enable reuse in future projects requiring CAN logging or external analog sensors."
  ],

  "results": [
    "Successfully built and tested a functional prototype of the CAN logger.",
    "The device enables long-duration logging of CAN traffic to the SD card, supporting offline analysis and debugging.",
    "HX711 integration provides analog load data for hydrodynamic drag measurements, expanding the logger's use cases.",
    "The project filled a critical gap in the team's data collection workflow and is ready for deployment in future boat tests.",
    "Additionally, the engineering thesis based on this project was successfully defended."
