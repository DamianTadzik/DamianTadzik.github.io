      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this project was to develop a robust temperature monitoring system for the BLDC motor windings on a solar-powered racing boat.
        This was part of an ongoing initiative within the <strong>AGH Solar Boat</strong> student research group.
        The motivation stemmed from a failure during the 2022 Monaco competition, where a faulty thermistor with an unknown characteristic led to a complete loss of thermal feedback.
        As a result, the helmsman unknowingly overheated the motor, leading to a critical failure during the race.
      </p>
      <p>
        To improve safety and system reliability, I proposed installing multiple NTC thermistors directly into the stator windings to provide redundant temperature feedback.
        Additionally, I initiated the implementation of an automatic cooling pump controller, removing the need for manual activation by the helmsman, which had previously led to several instances of human error.
      </p>

      <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Introduced redundant temperature sensing by embedding multiple NTC thermistors inside the motor windings.</li>
        <li>Proposed the software implementation of a lookup table (LUT)-based conversion from ADC values to temperature using linear interpolation.</li>
        <li>Reviewed and refactored team-written code to improve temperature readout precision — upgraded from whole degrees to two decimal places.</li>
        <li>Updated the CAN DBC file to reflect higher-resolution scaling for temperature values.</li>
        <li>Designed and supported the implementation of a proportional controller with hysteresis and saturation, used for temperature-based automatic water pump control.</li>
        <li>Initiated and coordinated the selection of a high-temperature epoxy adhesive (rated for 120°C) for securing thermistors inside the motor, in collaboration with the composites and electronics team.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The system provided accurate and redundant temperature feedback from multiple thermistors, significantly improving reliability compared to the previous setup.
        Automatic cooling control was successfully implemented and verified during system testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further work may include applying digital filtering (e.g., moving average or low-pass filters) to smooth ADC readings and reduce noise in temperature measurements.
