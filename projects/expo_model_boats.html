      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this project was to design and fabricate small-scale demonstration models that reflect the basic architecture of a solar-powered hydrofoil racing boat — including the hull, deck, struts with foils, propulsion system, and photovoltaic panel.
        These models were developed as part of the <strong>AGH Solar Boat</strong> initiative for use at the <strong>Osaka Expo 2025</strong>, as well as for showcases, presentations, and workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main educational goal was to demonstrate the conversion of solar energy into mechanical motion by driving a small propeller mounted on a small DC motor directly from a solar panel.
        The models were designed to be visually appealing, mechanically simple, and easy to assemble or mass-produce for hands-on demonstrations.
        They also serve as meaningful gifts for sponsors and partners.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extended version of the model included onboard electronics with an <strong>ESP32 Wi-Fi microcontroller</strong> and a custom PCB, enabling remote steering via a web interface. These interactive boats were capable of operation in small containers, making them ideal demonstrators for exhibition environments.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>What you did / implemented</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>Proposed and initiated the project based on Osaka Expo 2025 workshop goals set by the AGH Solar Boat supervisor.</li>
          <li>Designed a 3D-printable boat model sized to match available PV panels and miniature coreless DC motors.</li>
          <li>Validated that the PV panel could directly power the motor under strong lighting.</li>
          <li>Created a parametric CAD model and refined it through multiple 3D-printed prototypes for proper fit and performance.</li>
          <li>Built several units of the passive PV-powered demonstrator.</li>
          <li>Selected electronics (ESP32, H-bridge, servo, Li-Ion battery) for a motorized RC-capable version.</li>
          <li>Developed a PCB in EasyEDA, starting with a perfboard prototype.</li>
          <li>Integrated INA229 current/voltage sensors, SSD1306 OLED display, battery protection, and a basic PV DC-DC converter.</li>
          <li>Wrote firmware and a custom web interface for Wi-Fi steering via the ESP32.</li>
          <li>Redesigned the hull to house a steering mechanism with bearing, Li-Ion cell, servo, and full PCB integration.</li>
          <li>Conducted functional tests in a water tank during autonomous boat trials.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><strong>Interesting challenge</strong></li>
        <ul>
          <li>PCB layout constraints: fitting full monitoring and control circuitry into a compact board for a tiny hull space.</li>
          <li>Mechanical packaging: integrating the rudder linkage and bearings within the model’s limited internal volume.</li>
          <li>Firmware/UI: designing a responsive, minimalist Wi-Fi interface on a low-resource embedded system.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        The passive models reliably demonstrated PV-to-mechanical energy conversion and were successfully used in outreach events and presentations.
        The Wi-Fi-controlled version performed well in live demos, operated stably in small test tanks, and provided hands-on interactivity during workshops.
        Limitations included limited power output under indoor lighting and tight space constraints that required careful tuning of every subsystem.
