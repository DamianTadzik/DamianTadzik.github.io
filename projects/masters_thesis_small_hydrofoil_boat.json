  "title": "Masters thesis - Small hydrofoil RC boat (?)",

  "date": "June 2024 - September 2025",
  "technologies": ["Matlab", "CAD", "Control"],

  "overview": [
    "The goal of this project is to build a small-scale radio-controlled hydrofoil boat, intended as a test platform for control algorithms prior to deployment on the full-scale solar racing boat.",
    "The project is being developed independently during the summer, and if successful, it will become the foundation of my master's thesis."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Scaled down the full-sized 'Celka' boat model and CNC-milled the mold for the hull.",
    "Collaboratively sanded and prepared the mold surface with team members.",
    "Laminated the carbon fiber hull inside the mold with a colleague.",
    "Adapted the propulsion system and controller from a different boat (R.O.B.U.R.).",
    "Electronics, foil mounting, and control systems are in progress."
  ],

  "results": [
    "The project is still in progress. Key milestones like electronics integration and on-water tests are planned for the coming weeks."
