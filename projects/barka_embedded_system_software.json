  "overview": [
    "This project involved developing the embedded software for 'Barka', an autonomous robotic boat designed for the Roboboat 2025 competition.",
    "The system comprises a central control board ('Barka Board') and three distributed BMS (Battery Management System) boards, all interconnected via a CAN bus.",
    "The software was designed to be robust, modular, and easy to maintain for future AGH Solar Boat developers."
  ],

  "highlights": [
    "Reverse engineered and refactored legacy firmware for BMS boards based on STM32F3 MCUs; rewrote the entire codebase from scratch.",
    "Designed a modular FreeRTOS architecture with task grouping (common, master, slave) and dynamic task initialization based on jumper configuration.",
    "Researched and documented BQ series BMS chips, rewrote I2C drivers and configured key registers with rationale for each setting.",
    "Developed a CAN communication protocol with non-conflicting signal IDs and implemented control signal routing between master/slave BMS units.",
    "Implemented a robust fallback protocol and safe RF-based control system: Barka Board receives commands from a handheld controller and handles emergency stops.",
    "Enabled dual-mode propulsion: automatic mode controlled via onboard computer, and manual mode via pilot RF input (with signal override logic).",
    "Implemented control logic for boat subsystems including water pumps, lights, gimbal, robotic arm, FPV camera, and ventilation.",
    "Implemented telemetry forwarding from BMS units to the pilot controller: parsed battery data sent over CAN to the Barka board, then transmitted via UART through the RF transceiver using a reverse-engineered protocol."
  ],

  "results": [
    "Successfully deployed and tested the embedded system on the robotic boat.",
    "The system operated reliably and met safety and telemetry requirements for the Roboboat 2025 competition."
